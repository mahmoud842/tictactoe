5. **Responsive Design:**
   - Accessible and enjoyable gameplay on various screen sizes and devices.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5 for structure
- CSS3 for styling
- JavaScript for game logic and Minimax algorithm implementation

## How to Play
1. Open `index.html` in your web browser or just click on the live site link ( https://mahmoud842.github.io/tictactoe/ ).
2. choose either you want to play against AI or another player.
